### Description
A chatbot is an program that can simulate a conversation (or a chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications.   
To keep track of all the events conducted by the club, we maintain a spreadsheet that contains all the details related to upcoming and past events. You can find a sample of the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GRv7jN_AeL81XR2H620Bsin8EL3kcz3ZE71LvteDJ1Y/edit?usp=sharing).     
Your task is to build a chatbot that can answer various queries that a user will have related to the Web Enthusiast's Club and the events conducted by it.     
Some example queries are:
* Tell me about all the upcoming events.
* What is the last event conducted by web club.
* How many events did web club conduct in the month of November.
* Who is the convener of Web Club.*
* When was web club established.*   
and so on...   
**Note: Use dummy data wherever applicable*

### Tips 
1. Some of the queries based on club events will require you to fetch the results from the spreadsheet in realtime.
2. Bonus points will be provided depending on the multitude of queries that the chat bot will support.
3. Create a simple website and integrate this chatbot to the site. If executed well, this chatbot will be integrated with the new web club website.
