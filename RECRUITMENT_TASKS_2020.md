### Description
A chatbot is an program that can simulate a conversation (or a chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications.   
To keep track of all the events conducted by the club, we maintain a spreadsheet that contains all the details related to upcoming and past events. You can find a sample of the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GRv7jN_AeL81XR2H620Bsin8EL3kcz3ZE71LvteDJ1Y/edit?usp=sharing).     
Your task is to build a chatbot that can answer various queries that a user will have related to the Web Enthusiast's Club and the events conducted by it.     
Some example queries are:
* Tell me about all the upcoming events.
* What is the last event conducted by web club.
* How many events did web club conduct in the month of November.
* Who is the convener of Web Club.*
* When was web club established.*   
and so on...   
**Note: Use dummy data wherever applicable*

### Tips
1. Some of the queries based on club events will require you to fetch the results from the spreadsheet in realtime.
2. Bonus points will be provided depending on the multitude of queries that the chat bot will support.
3. Create a simple website and integrate this chatbot to the site. If executed well, this chatbot will be integrated with the new web club website.

2. Feel free to add your own modules or make changes to any of the modules listed above.  

### Tips:  
1. Bonus points if the values used by various modules instead of hardcoding, are loaded dynamically from a backend service/spread sheet/any other online storage.  
2. Give more importance to UI/UX.

### Description
Reddit is a website comprising user-generated content—including photos, videos, links, and text-based posts—and discussions of this content in what is essentially a bulletin board system.
Your task is to build a frontend client(web or app or cli) using the Reddit API which is openly available.
Basic features such as
* Viewing posts(text, images, videos or link previews) from the front page of Reddit
* Sorting posts according to Hot, New, Top, etc.
* Upvotes, awards and comments
should be implemented. Feel free add additional features such as authentication, allowing upvotes/downvotes etc.

## Task ID: multiplatform
####  `multiplatform development` `android` `iOS` `web development` `desktop application`

Mentors: [@mananpoddar](https://github.com/mananpoddarm) (+91 9113536695)

Tag: `Hard`

### Description
* As we get aware of more and more clients like mobile(android or iOS), web and desktop appliations, we should realise that if we want to develop an application supporting these many clients, we have to write the same logic for a feature over and over again right? Because every client have a different tech stack like web has javascript frontend frameworks, android has react-native etc which can develop package that can run over JVM, or windows desktop application can be developed using Microsoft's windows universal tool in c# or c++?
* I don't want to overwhelm you with loads of information, but believe me this task is doable and to explain it in the simple english at the risk of sounding technically disabled or ignorant(who cares xD), you should be able to write code once, and run that code over all these multiple clients without worrying about different tech stacks.
* There are multiple tools for developing such pipelines, like react or kotlin multiplatform plugin. you have to read the documentation carefully and try to develop such a pipeline and it can be for a very simple feature, as simple as a textbox which can just display the number of characters a user has inputted.


### Useful resources:
* kotlin multiplatform plugin - https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/mpp-intro.html
* comparison between different tools: https://steelkiwi.com/blog/flutter-vs-react-native-vs-xamarin-for-cross-platform-development/

### Tips
1. web and android or android and iOS can be an easy combination to start with.
